# Model Training
Features are best annotated in GIS software such as [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).
Once the annotations are curated the GeoCOCO Pyhton package can be used to convert the annotations to a coco format dataset.
This COCO dataset can then be viewed using fiftyone or converted to other formats such as YOLO format, using the ultralytics api.
